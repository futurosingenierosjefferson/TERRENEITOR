## TNT & Terreneitor - WRO 2024 Future Engineers 
The name of our team is TNT, we chose this name because we will explode the comptetition with our hard work and dedication! On the other hand, Terreneitor is the name of our autonomous robot, build by using lego and arduino together. We are a group of Venezuelan high schoolers who yearn to learn and be masters in robotics. TNT also have plenty of objectives like:

* Obtain expertise and mastery in robotics, engineering and self-driven robots.
*Learning how to cooperate and work as a team to solve problems with ingenious, imaginative, and creative solutions.
*Acquire knowledge regarding new and old technologies, information about eletronics, hardware, software, and more.
*Gain experience for opportunities or competitions that we might face in the future.
*Win the competition and enjoy the process through this exciting road!

TNT is form by three members (two of them 16 y.o. and one is 17 y.o.):

Raffaella Salama Arias
Emiliana Raquel Guerrero Ferm√≠ns
Nicola Pasquale Simone Perdomo
One thing that defines us, TNT, is that unlike others, we don't give up easily, we are determine to be the best and improve as much as possible, always looking for success and enjoying every part of the process. You can see this characteristic about us being really strong during "our journey, process and prototypes" below and in the Older versions of our final robot folder.
